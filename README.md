We don't personlly recommend that you use this Resource rather, we recommend that you use okokTalkToNPC.
With that being said, if you are prefering the "Open Source" version, than we do recommend this Resource. Although, we do want to state that you should keep your eyes out for an html release that would replace qb-menu! :)
